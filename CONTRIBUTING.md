# How to contribute

## Goals

- High performance
- Easy to use
- Easy to maintain

## Principle

- Tidy and clean code is grateful.
- Only develop common and helpful functions. RPC framework is an infrastructure rather than a business application.
- Try best to reduce coupling, but unnecessary abstraction is disgusting.
- Make best choice in framework rather than relying on users' configuration.


## Tips

- Do *NOT* delivery parameters by static methods, such as `ThreadLocal`.
